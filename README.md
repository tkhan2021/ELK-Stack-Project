# ELK-Stack-Project-I

Tanveer Khan 04/03/2021 SMU Cybersecurity Boot Camp

This is a collection of Linux scripts and Ansible scripts from my Cybersecurity Bootcamp class.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a JumpBox and a server running an ELK Stack container.
